# CompareFacesWebApp
Using face_recognition library, try to build a web app which helps comparing faces

1. compareFace.py compares a given images with a folder of images and returns all the images that match.


#TODO:
1. Add the logic to the web app
  a. users should be able upload any image to the database
  b. every image checked should first go to the common database and then processed for compareFace
  c. Need to take care of the overlapping names and overwriting of images.
